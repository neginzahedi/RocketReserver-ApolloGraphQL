## Tutorial Overview
In this tutorial, I learned how to:

- Download a schema
- Run code generation
- Write queries and mutations
- Handle errors
- Handle Pagination
- Authenticate with a backend server
- Use subscriptions to receive real-time updates

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Apollo iOS SDK Tutorial](<https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/tutorial/codegen-getting-started>) on the Apollo documentation website.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the majority of the code in this project is derived from the Apollo tutorial documentation. I utilized the tutorial as a learning resource to understand and implement GraphQL integration using the Apollo iOS SDK. The purpose of this project is educational, and the code is not original to me.
