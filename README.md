# Apollo iOS SDK

This is the tutorial application provided by Apollo for working with the Apollo iOS SDK to communicate with a GraphQL server.

In this tutorial I learned how to:

- Download a schema
- Run code generation
- Write queries and mutations
- Handle errors
- Handle Pagination
- Authenticate with a backend server
- Use subscriptions to receive real-time updates

Find the tutorial on [Apollo Docs]([https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/tutorial/codegen-getting-started]).
